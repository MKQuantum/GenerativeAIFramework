There are several considerations which will be important for adoption: 

* Generative AI will soon be ubiquitous in every aspect of the Enterprise so Governance will need to be an enabler and allow for growth - but with guardrails.
* Layered approach to Governance for Deployment of services and Creation of new solutions
* Start with the basics of Governance and build from there
* There is no "one size fits all" Governance and your Framework will need to change over time
* Provide Risk Management and Audit groups a baseline of what the "ideal state" looks like
* Invest in your teams with Education and Coaching
* Provide enough Risk Coverage to help the Enterprise understand how their [Risk Appetite](https://www.theirm.org/what-we-say/thought-leadership/risk-appetite-and-tolerance/) is affected
