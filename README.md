# Enterprise Governance Framework for Generative AI
<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121593006/236930142-97eb9410-6d36-4634-90ca-ca1009a775bb.png">

## This opinionated Framework covers  areas of compliance, risk, auditability, and management which would be important for any Enterprise that is interested in leveraging Generative AI for the enablement of their workforce and the benefit of their customers.

There are several considerations which will be important for adoption:

* Layered approach to Governance for Deployments and Creation
* Start with the basics of Governance and build from there
* Provide Risk Management and Audit groups a baseline of what the "ideal state" looks like
* Invest in your teams with Education and Coaching

## Intake

The intake is the entry point for a Governance Framework and may be different for various teams in the Enterprise.  Teams that are using Generative AI apps as a Service, such as leveraring it within an Excel sheet, will have a different entry point then teams that are creating solutions.  With the proliferation of Generative AI within browsers and other ubiquitous tools, a defined intake process becomes more important - but also more difficult to implement.

For situations where teams are leveraing Generative AI services that are provided within an Enterprises in a controlled manner, a web form with details such as:

- [ ] Name
- [ ] Department
- [ ] Use case
- [ ] One-up Manager Name

For development teams that are creating solutions, the Enterprises existing proceses to control Open Source dependencies and access controls to development environments could act as the first layer of defense.  

If an Enterprise is leveraging vendor tools which are used across the Enterprise, and which Generative AI has been added to, a Policy may need to be created to have Generative AI capabilities turned off by default.  Then, have users follow the process mentioned above where they enter details in a web form.

## Approvals

After intakes, the next important Governance component is Approvals.  Accountability will be important for the proliferation of Generative AI in Eneterprises since it will hold users responsible for there usage and provide oversight as well which can be tracked and audited.

## Training

While training AI Models is important, it is equally as important to prepare your Enterprise users to be trained to increase their Generative AI literacy.  Training is important for all new concepts and technologies within an Enterprise, but is even more important for technologies such as Generative AI that will have a profound effect on users daily work - and the risk appetitite of the Enterprise.

Some example of Training courses that could be provided are:

- [ ] High Level Introduction to AI (What is AI? What are considerations for society and busines?)
- [ ] Understanding Risk and Bias in AI
- [ ] DevOps and Cloud Native best practices fo AI
- [ ] Generative AI Introduction
- [ ] Generative AI Development

| Term | Description   |
| :-----: | :---: |
| Generative AI (GenA) | Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data. ([techtarget.com](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/generative-AI))  |
| Large Language Models (LLM)| A large language model, or LLM, is a deep learning algorithm that can recognize, summarize, translate, predict and generate text and other content based on knowledge gained from massive datasets. ([nvidia.com](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/01/26/what-are-large-language-models-used-for/#:~:text=A%20large%20language%20model%2C%20or,successful%20applications%20of%20transformer%20models.))  |
| Retrieval Augmented Generation| RAG retrieves data from outside the language model and augments the prompts by adding the relevant retrieved data in context ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/question-answering-using-retrieval-augmented-generation-with-foundation-models-in-amazon-sagemaker-jumpstart/#:~:text=To%20solve%20the%20constraints%20we,introduced%20by%20Lewis%20et%20al.))   |
| AI Hallucinations| When an AI is perceiving something that is not real. |
